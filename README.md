# Pharmacy-Management-System
DBMS Project - First year 

# Problem Statement :

The Pharmacy Management System has been created to assist pharmacies as managing with records on papers will be tedious and difficult to keep track of inventories with regards to the drugs in the store, expiry date, quantity of drugs available as well as the dealers whom they interacted with. It also helps generating an invoice during sales so as to make it a user friendly software.

# Objective :

The Main Objectives of our Project are as follows :-

* Maintain a DBMS for the Inventory, Sales, Dealers ,Purchases

* Sell the medicines to the customers by generating an invoice

* Check for the expiry and available stock before sales and store expired medicines in separate database for reference

* Also, provide security to the Pharmacy by ensuring that only owners can access the data with a login encryption

* Ensure user friendly interface and vivid visuals for ease of use
