# Pharmacy-Management-System
DBMS Project - First year

The Pharmacy Management System has been created to assist pharmacies as managing with records on papers will be tedious and difficult to keep track of inventories.

# Objective :

* Maintain a DBMS for the Inventory, Sales, Dealers ,Purchases

* Sell the medicines to the customers by generating an invoice

* Check for the expiry and available stock before sales and store expired medicines in separate database for reference

* Also, provide security to the Pharmacy by ensuring that only owners can access the data with a login encryption

* Ensure user friendly interface and vivid visuals for ease of use
